<h1>Project: Eviction Rates in NYC Post-COVID-19</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The main objective of the "Eviction Rates in NYC are Down Since COVID-19: Why the Pandemic Changed Eviction Trends" project was to understand why eviction rates have declined compared to pre-pandemic levels, despite the lapse of the initial eviction moratorium. To enhance this analysis, I examined data segmented by different racial demographics, merging datasets from NYC Open Data and the Census to explore correlations with poverty levels and median income. Prior to expert interviews, I employed statistical tools like multivariable linear regressions, t-tests, and chi-squared tests to develop a hypothesis.</p>

<h2>Methodological Insights</h2>
<p>A critical aspect of my analysis involved the distinction between eviction filings and executed evictions. Not all eviction filings lead to actual evictions, thus focusing on executed evictions gives a more accurate picture of the true eviction rates. To get a comprehensive understanding, I utilized both execution data from NYC Open Data and filing data from the Eviction Lab, exploring the story told by the discrepancies between these figures.</p>

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis and Story Angles</h2>
<p>During my exploratory analysis, I investigated various narratives. One perspective considered was the eviction rates in specific communities, such as Chinatown. I hypothesized that low-income immigrant neighborhoods might exhibit lower eviction rates due to the communal and cultural dynamics that influence landlord-tenant relationships, such as flexible rent policies common in cultural enclaves. This aspect represents an additional layer of complexity that could have been further explored if time constraints were not a factor.</p>
